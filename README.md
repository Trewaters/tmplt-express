# "tmplt-Express" - Boilerplate Express Server

version 0.1.0

This is template ("tmplt") code for an ExpressJS web server. I am using Winston for logging to file.

## Getting Started

The idea is to clone this repo for a basic ExpressJS web server. You can now start working on the rest of your app. I am sure the express CLI does the same thing. I don't always need that and I don't like not knowing what code went where. I haven't used the Express CLI but I like looking at working code and modifying what I need. This lets me do that.

### What the app should do?

1.  Starts a web server on ( `localhost:3333` )
2.  Serves an image on ( `http://localhost:3333/HewardsHandyHaversack/images/Model_Napa.jpg` )
3.  run with `node server`

I added "Hewards Handy Haversack" for fun. That can be changed or removed easily.
